I estimated that this project once again will take me 20 hours to complete

The amount of hours this project actually took was around 22 hours

What stopped me from making progress was the understanding of what maxDNA, myDNA, and mySize were in the project. Just understanding what those were was kind of confusing and took a lot of times where I had to step back and try to remind myself.

What I liked about the assignment is that a lot of it just builds off of project 1, so most of the functions don't take that much time at all. What I disliked was just understanding what maxDNA, myDNA, and mySize

What could make this project better would be to change the names of these values, such as making myDNA just be something like DNApointer.
