for project 6

I estimated that this project once again will take me 30 hours to complete

The amount of hours this project actually took was around 32 hours

I found the already written code in some files that could help me organized the code in other files, and give me an outline of what I am supposed to do.

I tried testing the files by utilizing the test files and with if and else statements, printing out if the tests failed. I did the same thing to test the queue implementation.

I enjoyed the organization of the project, I did not like the guitarstring files, as sound files still are very confusing for me.

Suggestion would be giving further information for the guitarstring files.
